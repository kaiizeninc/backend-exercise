# Kaiizen backend exercise

This is a Node/Typescript/Express exercise for backend roles at Kaiizen. It should take 1-2 hours to complete. A very basic framework is provided so that you can focus on the implementation work rather than the plumbing.

## Exercise

### Background

You run Greasy Wheel, a pizza delivery company. Greasy Wheel employs three drivers, Larry, Curly, and Moe, each of whom deliver pizzas via car to your customers.

For each pizza delivery, the delivery employee starts from your kitchen location in downtown Chicago, goes to the delivery address, and then returns to the central location for the next delivery.

### Problem

You need a dashboard to keep track of the deliveries that each driver is making. This dashboard should allow you to view all of the deliveries for all drivers, as well as recording new deliveries that each driver has made.

Additionally, the Pizza Delivery Drivers Union has negotiated that drivers cannot drive more than 100 miles in any given day. As a company owner, you need to monitor how far each driver has driven each day, as well as prevent adding deliveries if they'll cause the driver to exceed that distance.
